Cum Achīvī decem annōs in Troia fuissent, Epeus mirae magnitūdinis equum ligneum fēcit.

**When they❓*who?* had been in Troy for ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. Menelaus, Ulixēs, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus were gathered in it. And on the horse they wrote "The Greeks gave a gift to Minerva," and they carried over the military camp to Tenedos. When the Trojans saw this, Priamus led the horse into the temple of Minerva. When Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, they did not believe her and put the horse in front of the temple. The Greeks went out and killed the guards and acquired Troy.**
