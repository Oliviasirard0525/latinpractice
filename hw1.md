1. A regular Latin verb has four principle parts.
2. The first and third principle parts are finite verb forms. For the first principle part it uses the first person singular in the present active indicative, and for the third principle part it uses the first person singular in the perfect active indicative.
3. English can create different meanings using phrasal verbs by changing the words following a verb. The difference between faciō and interficiō is that the "a" in faciō turns into an "i" when inter is attached to the verb. However, the -ciō of the verb stays the same in both instances. **What about the other three parts?**
audīre and venīre; their principle parts are regular **Can you predict all *four* parts from the first part?**
The verb capiō is different from facio as there is an accent over the o. The changes in their principle parts are similar as the verbs follow the same pattern when changing from first, second, or third person.
